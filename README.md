More information about this project are available [here](./publiccode.yml). 

As explained in [italia/publiccode.yml-docs](https://github.com/italia/publiccode.yml-docs/blob/main/README.md) this is what the file is meant for:

> Many great software projects are developed by public administrations, however
> reuse of these projects is very limited. Some of the reasons for low uptake of
> such projects is a lack of discoverability and that it is hard to find out what
> project can actually work in the context of a different public administration.
> 
> The `publiccode.yml` file is meant to solve all those problems. As such, it is
> an easily readable file for civil servants that are trying to figure out
> whether a project will work for them, and easily readable for computers as
> well. It contains information such as:
> * the title and description of the project or product in English and/or other
>   languages;
> * the development status, e.g. `concept`, `development`, `beta`, `stable`,
>   `obsolete`;
> * which organisation developed the project;
> * who is caring for the maintenance and when this expires; 
> * who to contact for technical or support inquiries;
> * what national and local legal frameworks this project or product is designed
>   for;
> * what software dependencies this project or product has. 
>
> The `publiccode.yml` file format should both be able to easily be added to any
> new project, as well as grow with the project as it expands beyond the original
> context it was developed in.
